AnyoneCanLearn
==============

AnyoneCanLearn is a resource for software developers to help foster communities
focused on positivity and learning. 

Goals
----------------

One of the primary goals of this project is to provide resources to help 
beginners learn in an effective way. We're not about providing specific 
solutions to problems, but instead we want to provide you with the skills to 
discover those solutions yourself. 

Another goal is to help contributors – developers who are answering questions –
to do so in a constructive way. *How* we say something is just as important as 
*what* we say. This is especially true on the Internet and over media like 
Twitter, where nuance is difficult to convey. 

Status
----------------

This project is very early in its development, and it will continue to evolve 
and change over the coming months and, hopefully, years. If you have an idea for
how to make this better, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AnyoneCanLearn/AnyoneCanLearn/issues/new).
If you see an issue that you'd like to contribute to, leave a comment or open a
pull request. Everyone is welcome to have a say. 

Values
----------------

These are in flux, as this is still a very young project. 

- Anyone should be able to participate, learn, and teach.
- Respect others.
- Do no treat others differently because of their age, gender, sex, orientation, 
  ethnicity, ablebodiness, fluency in English, or any other personal 
  characteristics.

We believe that there should never be a circumstance where the barrier to entry
into our field is external to the person trying to enter it. No one should be 
made to feel bad because they don't know something because the fact of the 
matter is that computers are complicated and no one was born understanding how
to use them. 

Inspiration
----------------

There are several source of inspiration for this project. 

Matt Gemmell's inspirational resource for [asking well-formed questions](http://whathaveyoutried.com/)
is fantastic and fits well within our values. However, people began abusing it,
and the Stackoverflow community had to eventually decide on [how to deal](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122986/is-it-ok-to-leave-what-have-you-tried-comments)
with comments that only link tot hat resource. Matt's post is great, but we need
something to put it in context.

Several communities (like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) and 
[Python](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/)) have explicit Codes of 
Conduct for their communities. That's awesome! And they're tailored to the kinds
of issues those communities face. This project is intended to be a sort of meta
Code of Conduct that software developers choose to adhere to with the intention 
of fostering communities based on positivity. 

CocoaPods has a set of [communication guidelines](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Communication-&-Design-Rules)
that are a very good resource for how to communicate online, generally.
